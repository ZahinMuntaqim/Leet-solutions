# Valid String with Substring "abc" - Java Solution

## Problem Description

The problem asks you to check whether a given string can be reduced to an empty string by repeatedly removing the substring `"abc"`. If it's possible to reduce the string to an empty string through this operation, the string is considered **valid**; otherwise, it is **invalid**.

## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, you need to determine if it can be reduced to an empty string by repeatedly removing all occurrences of the substring `"abc"`.

### Example 1:

**Input**: `"aabcbc"`  
**Output**: `true`  
**Explanation**:  
`"aabcbc"` → `"ab"` (substring `"abc"` removed)  
The string cannot be further reduced, and it becomes valid.

### Example 2:

**Input**: `"abcabcababcc"`  
**Output**: `true`  
**Explanation**:  
`"abcabcababcc"` → `"abcabc"` → `"abcabcabc"` → `"abcabcababcc"` (substring `"abc"` removed several times)  
The string becomes empty, so it is valid.

### Example 3:

**Input**: `"abccba"`  
**Output**: `false`  
**Explanation**:  
There is no way to remove the substring `"abc"` from `"abccba"`, and the string cannot be reduced to an empty string.

## Solution

The solution works by repeatedly checking for and removing the substring `"abc"` from the input string. The string is processed until no further occurrences of the substring `"abc"` are found, at which point the function checks whether the string has become empty.

### Approach

1. **Check for substring `"abc"`**: The `contains()` method is used to check if `"abc"` is present in the string.
2. **Remove the substring `"abc"`**: The `replace()` method is used to remove all occurrences of `"abc"` from the string.
3. **Check if the string is empty**: After all possible occurrences of `"abc"` have been removed, the function checks if the string has become empty.

### Code

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isValid(String s) {
        // The substring to be repeatedly removed
        String substring = new String("abc");

        // Repeatedly remove the substring "abc" from the string as long as it is present
        while (s.contains(substring)) {
            s = s.replace(substring, "");
        }

        // If the string is empty, return true (valid), else return false (invalid)
        if (s.equals (""))
            return true;
        else
            return false;
    }
}
